# QR-Code-Generator
This code is a Python project that generates a QR code from the input of text or URL. 
The user interface is built using the Tkinter library, which provides a graphical user interface 
(GUI) for the application. The user can specify the size of the QR code, the location where the image 
should be saved, and the name of the image. The code uses the qrcode library to generate the QR code and 
saves the image in a .png format. The user can run the code in the Python environment to generate the QR code.
